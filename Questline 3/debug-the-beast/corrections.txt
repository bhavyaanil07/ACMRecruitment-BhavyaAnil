   ##program: Find the second largest number in a list
2. elif num > second:
            second = num
Here,
num!=largest should be given instead of num > second along with elif to restrict duplications .
3.if second == -9999999:
    second = 'none'
this should be given as an extra condition to avoid getting -9999999 when there is no 2nd largest number.
