# Reversing a String: Iterative and Recursive

##1.Iterative
We will use a loop to go backwards through the string from end to front and to build the reversed string by hand.
Steps:
1.Start at the last character of the string.
2.Add each character to the new string.
3.Stop when you reach the first character.

##2.Recursive
The problem is solved by breaking it down into smaller problems using recursion.
Steps:
1.Base Case: When the string is empty or has only 1 character, return it as is.
2.Recursive Case: Return the last character + the reverse of the rest of the string.
